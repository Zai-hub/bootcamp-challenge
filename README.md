# <Bootcamp-challeng-1>

## Description

The main goal of this project was to make the site more accessible.
I changed <div> codes into <main> as well as <section>. The purpose of this is to separate different parts of the webpage.
After some trial and error, I learned that some parts that I thouhght could be changed from <div> to <section>, would make the website less accessible.
