# Title: Horiseon- Digital Marketing Solutions

## Description
The main goal of this project was to make the site more accessible. 
The site has to be accessible to people with disabilities. 
Different things need to be added as an aid in order to navigate the website better.
The main/existing website was used for this. 
I changed `<div>` codes into `<main>` as well as `<section>`.
The purpose of this is to separate different parts of the webpage.
After some trial and error, I learned that some parts that I thouhght could be changed from `<div>` to `<section>`,would make the website less accessible.
'alt' was added after an image as a description. This is especially useful as it provides a short description when the corsor is on said image. 

## Installation
In order to access the file, I've first created a reposatory in my Github account. 
I then clone the file into my laptop using terminal.
Using VS Code, I apply all changes that make the Horiseon site more accessible with better user experience. 
Then, the file is `<git push>`ed into the relevant reposatory in my github account.
